# ReadMe: Student Mobility and College Admission Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student data to understand mobility patterns and their preferences for college admissions. Additionally, it explores how data platforms like India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX) can be leveraged to optimize transportation systems for students.

## Objectives
1. Investigate student data in relation to their preferred college admissions.
2. Explore how IUDX data can be used to enhance student commutes.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:**
   - Survey data collected through Google Forms, including demographic, commute, and college preference information.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent values.
   - Encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized commute modes, college preferences, and influencing factors.
   - Analyzed relationships between variables like commute distance and college selection factors.

4. **Machine Learning Implementation:**
   - Built a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of students considering the college for admission.
   - Evaluated model performance with metrics like accuracy (achieved 83%).

5. **Insights and Visualization:**
   - Generated graphs for commute preferences, branch choices, and influencing factors.
   - Cross-tabulated data for deeper insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Files
- `student_data.csv`: Input dataset collected from the survey.
- `analysis.py`: Python script for data analysis and visualization.
- `model.py`: Python script for machine learning implementation.

## Results
- Identified popular commute modes and factors influencing college admissions.
- Predicted student admission preferences with 83% model accuracy.
- Provided data-driven recommendations for urban planners and educational institutions.

## Future Work
1. Integrate real-time data from IUDX to enhance analysis accuracy.
2. Explore additional machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
3. Extend the study to include students from multiple cities for broader insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the utility of analyzing student data to inform decisions on urban planning and educational resource allocation. By leveraging platforms like IUDX, institutions can optimize commutes and enhance accessibility for students.
